# EaglePass v2 â€” Hall Pass and Accountability System (MVP)

**EaglePass v2** is a truthful, human-centered **hall pass and accountability system** for schools â€” built entirely within the **Google Workspace ecosystem**.

It is designed to operate safely under edge cases, reflect real-world student movements, and provide administrators and staff with accurate, auditable records â€” without functioning as an attendance or emergency response system.

---

## Project Goals

- Provide an accurate, auditable record of **student hall pass usage**.
- Support **teachers, support staff, and administrators** with clear UI.
- Prioritize **truthful state tracking** and **safe handling of edge cases**.
- Respect **user autonomy** â€” not a surveillance system.
- Be fully usable **within Google Workspace** â€” no third-party platforms required.

## Platform Architecture

- **Platform:** Google Workspace
- **Backend:** Google Sheets (data), Google Apps Script (logic)
- **Auth:** Google SSO (domain-based)
- **UI:** Google Apps Script Web Apps + HTML/CSS (role-based Panels)
- **Data Model:** 
    - Canonical source = **Pass Log**
    - Active state = **Active Passes**
    - Archive = **Permanent Record**

## Core Features (MVP Scope)

- **Student pass requests** â€” OUT â†’ IN flow
- **Teacher / Support Panels** â€” manage passes, view history
- **Admin Panel** â€” school-wide visibility, Emergency Mode control
- **Emergency Mode** â€” global state allowing staff to force IN

- **Edge Case Handling:** 
    - Period change
    - Emergency Mode persistence
    - Unknown students (TEMP-ID)
    - UI debounce / GAS pending states
